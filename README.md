## Set Secure Passwords for [ks.cfg](https://github.com/Bnwokoma/rocky-pxe-kickstart-lab/blob/main/mirror-configs/ks.cfg.sample)

```
openssl passwd -6
```

You'll be prompted to enter your desired password. Copy the resulting hash and paste it in place of the `$6$REPLACE_WITH_HASHED_PASSWORD` placeholders inside `ks.cfg`:
