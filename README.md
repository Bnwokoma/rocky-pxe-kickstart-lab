# Rocky Linux PXE Boot + Kickstart Lab

A step-by-step lab to build a fully automated PXE server for installing Rocky Linux 9.6 over the network using Kickstart. This lab is designed to be reproducible and beginner-friendly, with config examples and screenshots.

---

## Features
- PXE boot via `dnsmasq` (DHCP + TFTP)
- HTTP-based installer with mounted Rocky Linux 9.6 ISO
- Kickstart automation for headless installs
- Walkthrough-style documentation with screenshots
- Secure sample configs that hide sensitive data

- OS: Rocky Linux 9.5+ (PXE Server)
- Network: Bridge interface (`br0`) on the PXE server
- PXE Client: Any physical machine that supports network boot

---

## Repo Structure
- `walkthrough.md` â€“ full step-by-step setup
- `mirror-configs/` â€“ sample configs for you to copy (no real IPs)
- `screenshots/` â€“ proof-of-work images for each stage

## Security Notice
Do **not** push actual IP addresses or sensitive network config. Use `.sample` files instead. 

## Set Secure Passwords for ks.cfg

Before using this Kickstart file, generate a secure SHA-512 password hash on your PXE server or any Linux machine:

```bash
openssl passwd -6
```

You'll be prompted to enter your desired password. Copy the resulting hash and paste it in place of the `$6$REPLACE_WITH_HASHED_PASSWORD` placeholders inside `ks.cfg`:
