# Setting Up a Network Bridge (br0) for PXE Booting

#Step 1: Create the Bridge Interface

```
nmcli connection add type bridge autoconnect yes con-name br0 ifname br0
```

This creates a bridge named br0 and sets it to autoconnect on boot.

#Step 2: Assign a Static IP to the Bridge

####Replace the IP settings below with values that match your lab subnet.

Use ip a and ip route | grep default to help find these values.

Do not assign a static IP to both your bridge (br0) and your physical NIC.
Your NIC becomes a bridge slave and will no longer hold its own IP address.
Set the static IP only on br0 once bridging is configured.

```
nmcli connection modify br0 ipv4.addresses x.x.x.x/24
nmcli connection modify br0 ipv4.gateway x.x.x.1
nmcli connection modify br0 ipv4.dns 1.1.1.1
nmcli connection modify br0 ipv4.method manual
```

##Step 3: Attach Your Physical NIC to the Bridge

Replace enp1s0 with the name of your actual interface. You can run nmcli device status or ip a to find it.

```
nmcli connection add type bridge-slave autoconnect yes con-name br0-slave ifname enp1s0 master br0
```

##Step 4: Bring Up the Bridge

```
nmcli connection up br0
```

##Step 5: Verify the Bridge is Active

```
nmcli con show
```

You should see both br0 and br0-slave listed as active connections.

Also check:

```
ip a show br0
```

You should see the static IP you assigned.


When your PXE client boots, we can test connectivity with tcpdump

To verify that PXE clients can reach the PXE server over the bridge, run this command:

```
sudo tcpdump -i br0 port 67 or port 69 or port 4011
```

This listens for:

- DHCP (port 67)

- TFTP (port 69)

- PXE bootloader (port 4011)

You should see packets like DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPOFFER when a PXE client boots.

If you donâ€™t see any traffic, re-check:

- The PXE client is using the bridge.

- The PXE server is listening on br0.

- There are no firewalls blocking communication.
